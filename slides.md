### 1. The library is more than a collection of books

#### Services
* Research support
* Digital Design Studio
* Data Lab
* StAAR Center

#### Stuff
* Media Equipment
* Laptops / chargers / adapters
* Musical instruments (Lilly Music Library)
* Art Supplies (SMFA Library)

### 2. JumboSearch and the library catalog

#### Searching JumboSearch
* Keywords ("Any field")
* Limit search results
* Subject terms

### 3. Databases!

There is no perfect database

* Do I need primary or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need?
* Do I need a primary sources from a specific time period or region?
* What kind of secondary source do I need?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus like sociology or history?


### 4. Tisch library can be a portal to other libraries
* Interlibrary loan
* [Boston Library Consortium (BL9C)](https://blc.org/)
* [Boston Public Library e-card](https://www.bpl.org/ecard/)

### 5. Google Scholar and Tisch Library

#### Use Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### Remember, I'm here to help with this process.
