### 1. The library is more than a collection of books

### 2. Searching, searching, searching

#### Search scopes
* Tisch Library offers several options to search for books and articles
    * JumboSearch
    * Library catalog
    * Libraries worldwide

#### From keywords to subject terms
* Keywords ("Any field") searches:
    * title
    * author
    * table of contents / summary (if available)
    * subjects

* What keywords should I use?

* **Subject terms** are controlled vocabularies assigned to items by librarians. Subject searches may return fewer items, but the results are usually more relevant.

* Begin searching with keywords, but then search with the subject terms assigned to your best keyword results.


### 3. Databases!

There is no perfect database

* Do I need primary or secondary sources?
* What kind of primary source do I need?
* Do I need a primary sources from a specific time period or region?
* What kind of secondary source do I need?
* Do I need a specific disciplinary focus like sociology or history?


### 4. Tisch library can be a portal to other libraries
* Interlibrary loan
* [Boston Library Consortium (BLC)](https://blc.org/)
* [Boston Public Library e-card](https://www.bpl.org/ecard/)


### 5. Google Scholar and Tisch Library

#### Use Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous searches.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### Remember, I'm here to help with your research.
